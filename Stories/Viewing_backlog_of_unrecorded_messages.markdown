Viewing Backlog of Unrecorded Messages
======================================

As an IR, 

I want to be able to easily view my backlog of incoming, yet
unrecorded citizen messages,

so I know exactly what needs to be worked on.

* When there are incoming messages, I can see them in my message backlog.

* When there are messages that have already been recorded, I can no
  longer see them in my message backlog.
