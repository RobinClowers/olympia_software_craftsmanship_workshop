# Getting The System Under Test

### Agenda
Pretty much speaks for itself.

### The Value Of Testing
* Fundamentally, testing provides an assurance that implementation of the deliverables conforms to some set of expactations across a variety of areas: Functional/technical concerns (do pages load?), Business needs (does it do what we want it to?), etc
* Automated testing does this, with some caveats:
  * Your tests are going to only be as good as your team
  * Tests are not "fire-and-forget", they introduce a maintenance burden
  * Don't aim to use automated testing to eliminate the need for other kinds of testing.. think of it as "enhancing" the other components of your test effort, freeing those resources up for more productive work.
