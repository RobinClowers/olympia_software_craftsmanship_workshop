## Overview

The Olympia Software Craftsmanship Workshop is one day workshop,
developed with the intention of increasing the level of awareness of practices
and skills that can improve our software.

Any developer interested in improving and learning new skills is welcome.

We're going to focus on a scenario for a feature a customer wants. We'll do it
first using classic ASP.NET techniques. We'll show how it's difficult to maintain,
extend, and test.

Next, we'll use the techniques to componentize business functionality, extracting
it from the code behind in the ASP.NET project. 

We'll then add a new feature to the application, using our tests to make sure
nothing has been broken in the process.

We'll finish off by going over some other tools and techniques that can augment
what we've discussed.

## User Stories

To support this workshop, (and other activities and events), weâ€™ve decide to create a fictional customer, in a (mostly) fictional world. The fictional customer company will have employees, clients, a website, products, services, an attitude, etc. As we flesh it out, it can provide endless possibilities in terms of realistic examples.

While we do need realistic examples in terms of specific functional requirements, we do not want to be bored either, so humor is allowed and encouraged. (No real names should or will be used, to keep any real person or organization taking offense).

Let's use this theme any way that's useful. Consider it open-source. By building out more of the fictional world around the theme, we can apply it to all kinds of exercises. With a little planning, we can logically connect the exercises whether by parallels or by contrasts.

## Principles

The principles we want to focus on are:

* Using User Stories and TDD to focus on real customer value
* Refactoring legacy code to make it testable *before* adding new features
* [S.O.L.I.D.](http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/02/12/getting-a-solid-start)
* [INVEST](http://xp123.com/xplor/xp0308/index.shtml)
* [Individuals and interactions over processes and tools](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

## First Cut

We're going to do a first cut just building a plain old ASP.NET web forms 
application. We'll think about the first scenario in the stories, not considering 
the second story.

We'll create a web form with a [master detail view](http://designingwebinterfaces.com/designing-web-interfaces-12-screen-patterns), 
add a data source control, wire it with SQL in properties and all.

Next we'll look at adding the second scenario and show how it's difficult with
the poor design we've slapped together.

We'll consider things like extracting the SQL into a stored procedure and other
steps we might take to get this under control, and discuss the pros and cons of
each approach.

## Refactoring

We'll use the safe refactorings outlined in [Michael Feathers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052/ref=s9_sims_c2_s1_p14_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0S8D0VHK1WGVWC6Q21Q7&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=470938631&pf_rd_i=507846)
book to build seems and make the code we have so far testable.

First, we'll pull the data access code out of the ASPX page and into a service.
We'll have the code behind be responsible for creating the service and satisfying
any dependencies it has.

Next we'll discuss what's wrong with having the code behind be responsible
for creating the service and we'll look at some things we could do the address
those issues.

Once we have tests around the existing application - at least the part we are 
working on - we can move onto the next feature.

## TDD

We'll build another feature from scratch using TDD. We'll write the tests for
the code we wished we had then implement the feature.

## Other Practices

To wrap up, we'll touch on some other practices that make everything work better:

 * One-Step Builds
 * Continuous Integration
   - TeamCity
   - Hudson
 * Agile Estimation
